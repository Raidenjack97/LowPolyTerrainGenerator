Low Poly Terrain
======================================================


Description
------------
This project implements an editor extension for Unity to create Low Poly Terrains. It is still under development, but it works quite good. Currently, the built-in terrain editor of Unity does only support smooth surfaces. This tool will recreate Unity's terrain editor for procedural and manual terrain low-poly terrain generation and editing.
